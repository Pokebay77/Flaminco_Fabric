# Flaminco_Fabric
This mod adds 4 coins that uses a binary structure.

 

To use this mod, you place 1 diamond in the crafting grid to get 1 Copper Flaminco

2 Copper Flaminco = 1 Iron Flaminco

2 Iron Flaminco = 1 Gold Flaminco

2 Gold Flaminco = 1 Diamond Flaminco

 

You can also convert the coins back into diamond.

1 Diamond Flaminco = 2 Gold Flaminco

1 Gold Flaminco = 2 Iron Flaminco

1 Iron Flaminco = 2 Copper Flaminco

1 Copper Flaminco = 1 Diamond

Thats it!
